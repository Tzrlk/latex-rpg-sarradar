# Sarradar RPG

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Tzrlk/latex-rpg-sarradar.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Tzrlk/latex-rpg-sarradar)

These are the document sources for the pdf generation for the (nacent) Sarradar
tabletop RPG.

## Building

Run `build.cmd` or `build.sh` depending on the environment to kick-off the
build. The process uses Docker to encapsulate the needed tools, so if you
don't have access to docker, I'd recommend looking at the build files and
running the needed commands manually.

## License

All of the intellectual property related to the Sarradar setting belongs to
Patrick Cummuskey. The tabletop RPG itself is a joint project between him and
myself (Peter Cummuskey).
